  InnerHTML: `Surprisingly Deep Song Lyrics (SDSL) works largely the same way as Who Wants to be a Millionaire: there are a series of questions, with four possible answers to each one, and if you get all the questions right, you win. Get a question wrong, you lose. There are even hints you can use - three per turn on easy mode, and three for the whole game on hard - kind of like Millionaireâ€™s lifelines. The main difference - besides for not actually being able to win a million dollars - is that all the questions are song lyrics, and the answers are artists, one of which sang the song with the lyrics being displayed. And because the deeper purpose of this game is to showcase the awesome depth song lyrics can have, after each question a popup displays some of my reflections on why the lyrics pack a punch.`

  Title: 'About',
  InnerHTML: `Welcome! Surprisingly Deep Song Lyrics, or SDSL, is a happy outgrowth of my applying my interests to an assignment I was given while learning to code. A kind of "coding practice meets passion project." It's basically a gamified way to get players to pay more attention to song lyrics, and to notice that they can be - well, surprisingly deep. Guess it says it all in the name! Whether you pay attention to song lyrics already or you never paid any attention to them before, I hope this game opens your eyes to some really profound, powerful prose (or I guess poetry, technically).`
