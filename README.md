## What is SDSL?

SDSL works largely the same way as _Who Wants to be a Millionaire_: there are a series of questions, with four possible answers to each one, and if you get all the questions right, you win. Get a question wrong, you lose. There are even hints you can use - three per turn on easy mode, and three for the whole game on hard - kind of like _Millionaire_â€™s lifelines.

The main difference (besides for not actually being able to win a million dollars) is that all the "questions" are song lyrics, and the answers are artists, one of which sang the song with the lyrics being displayed. And, because the deeper purpose of this game is to showcase the awesome depth song lyrics can have, after each question a popup displays some of my reflections on why the lyrics pack a punch. You'll probably skip these if you're just here to play, but if you're looking for something deeper, I think they're worth the read.

## Credits

The win, lose and reveal audios came from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/) and [Orange Free Sounds](https://orangefreesounds.com/). And thanks to [Anthony Medina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonyjmedina/) for pointing them out to me.

All of the lyrics and music obviously belong to the amazing artists that created them. I won't be naming names, of course - spoilers! - but thanks for putting words to those things we knew but couldn't express, or didn't know but now can enrich our lives.

And a special thanks to my peers and instructors at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/new-york-city), particularly [Ashley Sands](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-sands/), [Jan Horak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-horak/) and Pod 3 (you may or may not know who you are).
