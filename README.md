## _**Description**_

This game is modeled off of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" - the basic premise is, if you answer ten questions correctly in a row, you win. You get four choices for each question, and you even get hints.

But there's a twist: this game is focused on, as the title suggests, deep song lyrics, and identifying which band sang them. And it invites some reflection - after each question, the player gets a chance to leave a comment about what the lyric means to them, accessible on a linked HTML page.

I hope this game tests players' musical knowledge, and gets them thinking more about music and about life!
